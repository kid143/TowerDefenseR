TowerDefenseR
=============
This is a demo game for learning cocos2d-x v3.0. 
The project mainly refers to [this tutorial](http://www.raywenderlich.com/37701/how-to-make-a-tower-defense-game-tutorial), but I've made the bullet hit detection more extensible.

If you are going to build a larger game based on this project, there's a lot to do.
